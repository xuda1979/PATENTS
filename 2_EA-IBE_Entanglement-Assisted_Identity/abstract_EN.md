# Patent Abstract

## Entanglement-Assisted Identity-Based Encryption (EA-IBE)

---

### Abstract

**Technical Field**: The present invention relates to quantum communication, identity management, and IoT security, specifically to an identity-based encryption system leveraging quantum entanglement for decentralized identity verification.

**Technical Problem**: Traditional Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) relies on Trusted Third Parties (TTP) to generate and distribute private keys, creating single points of failure, scalability limitations, and vulnerability to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks during key distribution.

**Technical Solution**: An entanglement-assisted identity-based encryption system comprising: (1) a central identity hub configured to generate and distribute entangled photon pairs to network nodes through a quantum mesh network; (2) an identity extraction module at each node configured to derive cryptographic primitives from local measurements of entangled states correlated with the node's unique network identifier; (3) a Bell-inequality verification protocol that validates entanglement integrity before key derivation to prevent MITM attacks; (4) a topological addressing scheme where public keys are derived from network topology positions; and (5) a quantum state routing protocol enabling multi-hop entanglement distribution.

**Technical Effects**: The invention eliminates reliance on classical certificate authorities through physics-based identity binding; provides MITM resistance through Bell-inequality verification that detects any interception attempt; achieves scalable decentralized identity management suitable for large-scale IoT deployments; and enables zero-trust architecture where identity verification requires no pre-shared secrets.
